(defn copy
  "Byte-exact copy of `src` to `dst`. With three arguments both paths are on
  the same handle; with four, `src` is read from `src-fs` and written to
  `dst-fs`, which is how a copy crosses two separately granted roots.

  Goes through the byte face, not the text face, so content that is not valid
  UTF-8 survives. Returns nil.

  There is no `:replace`/`:append` option: `write-bytes` replaces, which is
  what a host-level `copy` into a file does."
